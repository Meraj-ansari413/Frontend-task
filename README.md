# Frontend-task
Approach -Frontend-focused design - Clean UI with a green color scheme reflecting the environmental focus
Component-based architecture - Clear separation of sections for features, benefits, and onboarding
Dashboard-centric approach - The bottom part shows what appears to be an analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
SaaS (Software as a Service) model - Evident from the "Getting Started is easy" and login/sign-up features
